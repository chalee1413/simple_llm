    "prompt": "Explain what machine learning is",
    "chosen": "Machine learning is a subset of artificial intelligence that enables computers to learn from data without explicit programming. It uses algorithms to identify patterns and make predictions.",
    "rejected": "Machine learning is programming."
  },
  {
    "prompt": "What is the difference between supervised and unsupervised learning?",
    "chosen": "Supervised learning uses labeled data to train models, while unsupervised learning finds patterns in unlabeled data. Supervised learning requires examples with correct answers.",
    "rejected": "They are the same thing."
  },
  {
    "prompt": "Describe neural networks",
    "chosen": "Neural networks are computing systems inspired by biological neurons. They consist of interconnected nodes organized in layers that process information through weighted connections.",
    "rejected": "Neural networks are just computers."
  },
  {
    "prompt": "What is reinforcement learning?",
    "chosen": "Reinforcement learning is a type of machine learning where an agent learns to make decisions by interacting with an environment and receiving rewards or penalties.",
    "rejected": "Reinforcement learning is just trial and error."
  },
  {
    "prompt": "Explain deep learning",
    "chosen": "Deep learning uses neural networks with multiple layers to learn complex patterns in data. It has been successful in image recognition and natural language processing.",
    "rejected": "Deep learning is just neural networks."
  },
  {
    "prompt": "What is transfer learning?",
    "chosen": "Transfer learning applies knowledge from one task to a related task, allowing models to leverage pre-trained weights and require less training data.",
    "rejected": "Transfer learning is copying models."
  },
  {
    "prompt": "Describe gradient descent",
    "chosen": "Gradient descent is an optimization algorithm that minimizes a function by moving in the direction of steepest descent, used to update model parameters.",
    "rejected": "Gradient descent is just going downhill."
  },
  {
    "prompt": "What is overfitting?",
    "chosen": "Overfitting occurs when a model learns training data too well, including noise, resulting in poor performance on new data.",
    "rejected": "Overfitting is when a model is too good."
  },
  {
    "prompt": "Explain regularization",
    "chosen": "Regularization prevents overfitting by adding a penalty term to the loss function, helping models generalize better.",
    "rejected": "Regularization is just making models simpler."
  },
  {
    "prompt": "What is a loss function?",
    "chosen": "A loss function measures how well model predictions match actual values, quantifying error for training optimization.",
    "rejected": "A loss function is just a way to measure error."
